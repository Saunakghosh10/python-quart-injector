# Overview

```{rst-class} lead
[Injector](https://pypi.org/project/injector/) based dependency injection for 
[Quart](https://pypi.org/project/quart/) web applications.
```

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used to wire up components with each
other. Combining injector and quart brings DI functionality to async web apps. Views
define the interfaces they depend on. The framework then provides those dependencies
when and where they're required.

You can abstract common funcionality like database access into shared components. Define
a dependency on those components from your views. The dependencies get injected into the
views instead of duplicating the instantiation logic. No globals, less mess, cleaner
code.

quart-injector draws heavy inspiration from 
[Flask-Injector](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Injector/). But rather than be a direct
port, its a from scratch reimplementation for quart.
